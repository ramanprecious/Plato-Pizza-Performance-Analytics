# [Plato's Pizza Analytics Analytics](https://github.com/ramanprecious/Data-Analyst-Portfolio-PowerBI/tree/main/Covid19%20Analytics)

### Problem Statement
There is a need for Plato's Pizza to improve its operations by employing data. Nowadays, many businesses are adopting data in their development and everyday decision making. If they are not employed, there will be a drastic reduction in their profitability. Thus, Plato's Pizza has decided to utilize the collected transactional data for the past year to make decisions through data analytics to drive more sales and work more efficiently.

### Questions
The questions required by the stakeholders to be answered include:

• On what days and times do we tend to be busiest?

• What are our best and worst selling pizzas?

• What's our average order value?

• How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any
seasonality in the sales?

### Insights
The dashboards designed for the performance evaluation of Plato's Pizza Place reveal many hidden insights that can serve as factor for better optimization of the business and increasing revenue generation. These insights include:

1. Total revenue generated in 2015 was $818K.
2. The total number of orders recorded in 2015 was 21,350, and the average order value was $38.
3. A continuous dip in orders and revenue generation was observed between August and October.
4. The lowest sales growth percentage occurred between November and December, while the highest was between October and November. It seems that the sales strategy employed in October to raise revenue was short-term and unable to fully mitigate the challenge, thereby causing a plunge in revenue generation.
5. Many customers prefer the classic flavor to other ones.
6. The large pizza size has the most orders and contributes largely to the total revenue. This is closely followed by small pizzas.
Classic Deluxe has the highest order among all pizzas.
7. The pizzas that contribute the most to the revenue are Thai Chicken, Barbecue Chicken, California Chicken, Classic Deluxe, and Spicy Italian.
8. July was a rainy month with large orders and high revenue. 
9. Most orders were made on Fridays.
10. Most orders on Fridays and Saturdays are made around 9 p.m.–10 p.m. This can be attributed to weekend parties and hangouts among friends.
Weekday orders are higher around 12pm - 2pm and 4 - 6pm which are official lunch hours and after-work hours.

### Recommendations
1. There is an increased demand for certain types of pizza. More so, these demands are so peculiar during the rush hours (1pm-2pm, 4pm-6pm) everyday. A slight increase in the price of the most ordered products like Chicken deluxe, Pepperoni, Hawaiian, Pepperoni, Barbecue chicken, Thai chicken, California chicken, Spicy Italian, Sicilian, and Four cheese would boost the Average Order Value.
2. More provision of the most ordered pizza, especially during rush time.
3. Upselling and Product recommendations will improve the sale of less-ordered items.
4. The inclusion of products' add-ons like extra pepperoni, extra cheese, etc. will allow customers to purchase other pizzas with a familiar flavor add-on.
5. Give discounts to customers who buy in large quantities.
6. Creation of bundles that contain both high performing and low performing pizzas. This will boost revenue.
7. Collection of additional information on customers will assist  in detecting new insights to make good sales and marketing decisions.
